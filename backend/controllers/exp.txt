controllers/: This is where you put your business logic. Controllers receive requests from the routes and then interact with the models or other services to process the request and send a response. This separation keeps the routes file clean and focused on URL paths.

authController.js: Contains functions like registerUser, loginUser, etc.

accountController.js: Contains logic for creating, fetching, and updating accounts.

transactionController.js: Contains logic for creating, fetching, and updating transactions.
